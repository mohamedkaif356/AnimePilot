   Explanation for issues of type "MissingPermission":
   This check scans through your code and libraries and looks at the APIs
   being used, and checks this against the set of permissions required to
   access those APIs. If the code using those APIs is called at runtime, then
   the program will crash.

   Furthermore, for permissions that are revocable (with targetSdkVersion 23),
   client code must also be prepared to handle the calls throwing an exception
   if the user rejects the request for permission at runtime.

    kapt(libs.room.compiler)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "KaptUsageInsteadOfKsp":
   KSP is a more efficient replacement for kapt. For libraries that support
   both, KSP should be used to improve build times.
